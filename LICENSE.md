## 2. Definitions

- Software” means the source code, object code, documentation, and other files distributed under this License.
- “Non‑Commercial Use” means any use that is not Commercial Use, including personal, hobby, academic, research, or classroom use, where no direct or indirect compensation, revenue, or commercial advantage is received in connection with the use of the Software.

  - in or for the internal operations of any business, company, government, or other organization, where such operations support commercial activities, revenue generation, or business functions (including SaaS, hosted services, enterprise systems, or production infrastructure).

If a use does not clearly fall within Non‑Commercial Use, it is considered Commercial Use.

For Non‑Commercial Use, you may:

- use, copy, and modify the Software and derivative works;

- you do not charge any fee or receive any compensation specifically for the Software or any product or service that primarily derives its value from the Software.

## 4. Commercial Use Requires Separate License

Commercial Use of the Software is not permitted under this License.

To engage in any Commercial Use, you must obtain a separate Commercial License from the Licensor under terms negotiated with the Licensor.

This License does not grant any rights to use the Licensor’s name, logos, or trademarks.

## 6. No Sublicensing

You may not sublicense the rights granted under this License.

Any distribution you make must be under the terms of this License (for non‑commercial recipients) or under a separate agreement directly from the Licensor.

## 7. Termination

This License automatically terminates if you breach any of its terms.

Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy any copies in your possession or control.

Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including, without limitation, Sections 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9) will survive termination.

The Licensor may, at its discretion, offer reinstatement of this License if you cure the breach and provide reasonable assurances of future compliance.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.

YOU BEAR ALL RISK AS TO THE USE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THE LICENSOR’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE NON‑COMMERCIAL LICENSE TO THE SOFTWARE.

## 10. Governing Law

This License will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America, without regard to its conflict‑of‑law principles.

## 11. Entire Agreement

This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Licensor concerning the Software for Non‑Commercial Use and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.

If you tell how strict you want “internal business use” to be (e.g., is a solo freelancer using it for a client “commercial”? pre‑revenue startup?), this can be tuned with more precise examples or carve‑outs.
