    InferaDB is a high-performance authorization engine implementing Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) in Rust.

    ## Authentication

    InferaDB uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Include your JWT in the `Authorization` header:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
    ```

    Supported authentication methods:
    - **Private-Key JWT (RFC 7523)** - For tenant SDKs and CLIs
    - **OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens (RFC 6749)** - For dashboards and enterprise authentication
    - **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** - Automatic JWKS discovery

    See [Authentication Guide](../docs/security/authentication.md) for details on creating JWTs.

    ## Rate Limiting

    Rate limiting is configured per deployment. Default limits:
    - 1000 requests per minute per IP
    - 10000 requests per minute per tenant

    Rate limit headers are included in responses:
    ```
    X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
    X-RateLimit-Reset: 1730905200
    ```

    ## Consistency Guarantees

    - **Read-Your-Writes**: After a write, subsequent reads from the same client will see that write
    - **Snapshot Isolation**: All operations within a request see a consistent snapshot
    - **Eventual Consistency**: Multi-region deployments may have slight replication lag

        Check if a subject has a specific permission on a resource.

        This is the primary authorization endpoint. It returns a simple allow/deny decision.

        Optionally, you can enable detailed evaluation tracing by setting `trace: true` in the request.
        This provides complete visibility into the authorization decision process, including which relationships
        were evaluated and why the final decision was made.

        **Performance**: Typical latency is <5ms for simple checks, <20ms for complex nested relations.
        Enabling trace adds minimal overhead (~1-2ms).

      summary: List accessible resources
      description: |
        Lookup all resources of a given type that a subject can access with a specific permission.

        This is the reverse of `/check` - instead of checking if a subject has access to one specific resource,
        this returns all resources the subject can access.

        **Use Cases**:
        - Listing files a user can view
        - Showing organizations a user is a member of
        - Finding all documents a user can edit

        **Performance**: Typical latency varies with resource count:
        - 1K resources: <10ms
        - 10K resources: <100ms
        - 100K resources: <1s (use pagination)

        **Pagination**: Use `limit` and `cursor` to paginate through large result sets.

      summary: List resources with Server-Sent Events streaming
      description: |
        List accessible resources and stream them as they're discovered using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

        This is useful for large result sets where you want to show results progressively
        instead of waiting for the entire response.

        **Events**:
        - `message` events: Individual resources as they're discovered
        - `summary` event: Final metadata (cursor, total_count, complete flag)

        **Example client code**:
        ```javascript
        const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/v1/list-resources/stream');
        eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
          const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
          console.log('Found resource:', data.resource);
        };
        eventSource.addEventListener('summary', (event) => {
          const summary = JSON.parse(event.data);
          console.log('Complete:', summary.complete);
          eventSource.close();
        });

      summary: List relationships
      description: |
        List authorization relationships with optional filtering.

        This endpoint is useful for:
        - **Debugging**: Inspect what relationships exist in the system
        - **Administration**: Build UIs showing who has access to what
        - **Auditing**: Track authorization state over time
        - **Data Export**: Extract relationships for backup or analysis

        **Filtering**: All filter parameters are optional and can be combined:
        - `resource`: Filter by exact resource (e.g., "doc:readme")
        - `relation`: Filter by relation type (e.g., "viewer")
        - `subject`: Filter by exact subject (e.g., "user:alice")

        **Pagination**: Default limit is 100 relationships, maximum is 1000 per request.

        **Performance**: Queries use storage indexes for optimal performance.
        Typical latency is <10ms for filtered queries, <50ms for full scans.

      summary: List relationships with Server-Sent Events streaming
      description: |
        List relationships and stream them as they're discovered using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

        Useful for large result sets (e.g., listing all relationships for auditing)
        where you want to show results progressively.

        **Events**:
        - `message` events: Individual relationships as they're discovered
        - `summary` event: Final metadata (cursor, total_count, complete flag)

        **Example client code**:
        ```javascript
        const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/v1/list-relationships/stream');
        eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
          const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
          console.log('Found relationship:', data.relationship);
        };
        eventSource.addEventListener('summary', (event) => {
          const summary = JSON.parse(event.data);
          console.log('Complete:', summary.complete);
          eventSource.close();
        });
        ```

      summary: Write relationships

        Write one or more authorization relationships.

        Relationships define access control relationships between subjects and resources. For example:
        - `user:alice` is a `viewer` of `document:readme`
        - `group:engineers` is a `member` of `org:acme`

        **Best Practice**: Batch multiple relationships in a single request for better performance.

      summary: Delete relationships
      description: |
        Delete authorization relationships using exact matches or filter criteria.

        **Deletion Methods:**
        - **Exact deletion**: Specify relationships array with specific tuples to delete
        - **Filter-based deletion**: Use filter to delete all matching relationships
        - **Combined**: Both filter and exact relationships can be used together

        **Common Use Cases:**
        - **User offboarding**: Delete all relationships for a subject (user leaving organization)
        - **Resource cleanup**: Delete all relationships for a deleted resource
        - **Bulk updates**: Delete relationships matching a pattern (e.g., all "viewer" relations)
        - **Relation cleanup**: Delete all relationships of a specific relation type

        **Safety Features:**
        - Default limit of 1000 relationships when using filters (prevents accidental mass deletion)
        - Empty filter validation (at least one filter field required)
        - Set limit=0 for unlimited deletion (use with caution!)

        **Examples:**

        User offboarding (delete all relationships for a subject):
        ```json
        {
          "filter": {
            "subject": "user:alice"
          }
        }
        ```

        Resource cleanup (delete all relationships for a resource):
        ```json
        {
          "filter": {
            "resource": "doc:deleted_document"
          }
        }
        ```

        Combined filter fields (delete specific resource+relation):
        ```json
        {
          "filter": {
            "resource": "doc:readme",
            "relation": "viewer"
          }
        }
        ```

        With explicit limit:
        ```json
        {
          "filter": {
            "subject": "user:alice"
          },
          "limit": 100
        }
